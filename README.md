# SparseConvEncoderDecoder using Open3D-ML
The source code for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation using SparseConv, required for GSOC qualification assignment.


**Highlights of the implementation:**

* Integrated with Open3D-ML
* Closely follows pipeline format use to run other models in Open3D-ML
* Submanifold Sparse Convolution is utilised.
* 3D Visualization of the prediction.
